          <h2 class="section-heading"> 20 Lessons from Niccol√≤ Machiavelli</h2>
          <h3> Genre: Political Science
Advice from the book banned by the church for 200 years. While the advice doesnt apply to most of us, it is good to know. </h3>

          <p>1) Wicked tend to win bc they do whatever it is needed to win even if it is wrong.
2) Do not trust third parites( auxiliaries or mercenaries), create your own troops from your own state.
3) Every good person should learn from the crooked so they can see the effort the wicked are willing to achieve the same end as you.
4) It is far better to be feared than loved but avoid hatred at all cost from your troops.
5) Most of the time, being effective and nice ruler is not possible.
6) It is better to inspire terror but careful you do not misuse or get addicted to it.
7)Evaluate your inner circle, fill them w their desires for they will have to be the most loyal and relentless to fulfill your tasks.
8) A good ruler should have following virtues: wisdom, stragets, strength, brave and when necessary ruthless.
9)The only sound, sure and enduring methods of defence are those based on your own actions and skills.
10) Get people to favour you, not your occupation/title.
11)Do not fall for cheap dopamine or flattery which clouds your judgement. 
12) Always make firm decisions because conflicting advice/action will be held in low esteem by others.
13) Value opinions from those who act towards your goal and if someone holds backs the truth, be ready to show your wrath.
14)Never to join aggressive alliance with someone powerful than you unless absolutely necessary.
15)Be in a constant state of endevaours so people in your team do not have time to queity plot against you.
16)Show the illusion of being nice and having good morals like Marcus Aurelius even if you are not for the public while simualteonley be cunning and dark like roman emepror severus who did waht he had to do to achieve his end.
17)Do not act like a lion all the time as lions can be trapped.
18) When occupying foreign land, always inspire smooth transition of power destorying the main power, placing a partisian, settling there yourself,letting them keep their own laws and culture and be ruthless to rebels.
19) Men must either be pampherd or crushed.
20) Never be put in power as pawns by upper classes bc you will not be able to rule yourself and will be doing favours in your dominion.

          <p>Machiveli's address our dark human nature to achieve ends. We shouldnt blame those who are in power like politican to be curel rather learn from them and do better. </p>
          <p>

2)Animosity: strong hate

5)dominion: rulling or controlling power
6)strife: bitter conflict
7)dissension: disagreement
8)prudence: ability to self discipline
